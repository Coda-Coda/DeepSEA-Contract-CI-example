# Continuous Integration for DeepSEA proofs (experimentation)

Please note that this is an **unofficial** approach - it is an experiment at using continuous integration based upon using [Nix](https://nixos.org/) to build DeepSEA and then check a proof of a contract. DeepSEA is publicly available at https://github.com/certikfoundation/deepsea (or with minor tweaks at https://github.com/Coda-Coda/deepsea-1).
